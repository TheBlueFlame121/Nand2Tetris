These are the basic chips we made in week 1. While I was doing these, I hadn't realised till about halfway through that you could reuse the chips you had made. As a result of this, some chips like Or16 & And16 are made entirly out of nand gates.

Another thing I used while writing these was using a simple python print loop for those long 16 bit chips.
